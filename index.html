					The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonian is a random quadratic function on the high-dimensional sphere. This article studies the ground state (i.e. maximum) of this Hamiltonian with external field, or more generally with a non-linear "spike" term. We compute the level of the maximum to leading order, and under appropriate condition its first- and second-order fluctuations. The equivalent results are also derived for the maximum of the model's TAP free energy on the ball.

					Spin glass models involving multiple replicas with constrained overlaps have been studied in [FPV92; PT07; Pan18a]. For the spherical versions of these models [Ko19; Ko20] showed that the limiting free energy is given by a Parisi type minimization. In this work we show that for Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (i.e. 2-spin) interactions, it can also be expressed in terms of a Thouless-Andersson-Palmer (TAP) variational principle. This is only the second spin glass model where a mathematically rigorous TAP computation of the free energy at all temperatures and external fields has been achieved. The variational formula we derive here also confirms that the model is replica symmetric, a fact which is natural but not obviously deducible from its Parisi formula.

				<div class="abstract" id="inj">
					When can the input of a ReLU neural network be inferred from its output? In other words, when is the network injective? 
					We consider a single layer, \(x \mapsto \mathrm{ReLU}(Wx)\), with a random Gaussian \(m \times n\) matrix \(W\), 
					in a high-dimensional setting where \(n, m \to \infty\).
					Recent work connects this problem to spherical integral geometry giving rise to a conjectured sharp injectivity threshold for  \(\alpha = \frac{m}{n}\) by studying the expected Euler characteristic of a certain random set.
					We adopt a different perspective and show that injectivity is equivalent to a property of the ground state of the spherical perceptron, an important spin glass model in statistical physics. By leveraging the (non-rigorous) replica symmetry-breaking theory, we derive analytical equations for the threshold whose solution is at odds with that from the Euler characteristic. Furthermore, we use Gordon's min--max theorem to prove that a replica-symmetric upper bound refutes the Euler characteristic prediction. 
					Along the way we aim to give a tutorial-style introduction to key ideas from statistical physics in an effort to make the exposition accessible to a broad audience.
					Our analysis establishes a connection between spin glasses and integral geometry but leaves open the problem of explaining the discrepancies.

					We study the number of local maxima with given radial derivative of spherical

					for the number of local maxima with given radial derivative and given energy the corresponding

					<br/>
					We use standard Kac-Rice computations to derive formulas for the first and second moment
					at exponential scale, and then find a remarkable analytic argument that shows that the second

					This also leads to a new proof of a central inequality used to prove concentration of the

					We solve the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) variational principle associated to the spherical pure p-spin mean field spin glass Hamiltonian and present a detailed phase diagram.

					The high temperature phase consists of three subphases. (1) In the first phase m=0 is the unique relevant TAP maximizer. (2) In the second phase there are exponentially many TAP maximizers, but m=0 remains dominant. (3) In the third phase, after the so called dynamic phase transition, m=0 is no longer a relevant TAP maximizer, and exponentially many non-zero relevant TAP solutions add up to give the annealed free energy.

					U-Nets have been tremendously successful in many imaging inverse problems. In an effort to understand the source of this success, we show that one can reduce a U-Net to a tractable, well-understood sparsity-driven dictionary model while retaining its strong empirical performance. We achieve this by extracting a certain multiscale convolutional dictionary from the standard U-Net. This dictionary imitates the structure of the U-Net in its convolution, scale-separation, and skip connection aspects, while doing away with the nonlinear parts. We show that this model can be trained in a task-driven dictionary learning framework and yield comparable results to standard U-Nets on a number of relevant tasks, including CT and MRI reconstruction. These results suggest that the success of the U-Net may be explained mainly by its multiscale architecture and the induced sparse representation.

					The Neural Tangent Kernel is an important milestone in the ongoing effort to build a theory for deep learning. Its prediction that sufficiently wide neural networks behave as kernel methods, or equivalently as random feature models arising from linearized networks, has been confirmed empirically for certain wide architectures. In this paper, we compare the performance of two common finite-width convolutional neural networks, LeNet and AlexNet, to their linearizations on common benchmark datasets like MNIST and modified versions of it, CIFAR-10 and an ImageNet subset. We demonstrate empirically that finite-width neural networks, generally, greatly outperform the finite-width linearization of these architectures. When increasing the problem difficulty of the classification task, we observe a larger gap which is in line with common intuition that finite-width neural networks perform feature learning which finite-width linearizations cannot. At the same time, finite-width linearizations improve dramatically with width, approaching the behavior of the wider standard networks which in turn perform slightly better than their standard width counterparts. Therefore, it appears that feature learning for non-wide standard networks is important but becomes less significant with increasing width. We furthermore identify cases where both standard and linearized networks match in performance, in agreement with NTK theory, and a case where a wide linearization outperforms its standard width counterpart.
